## Project 1 Home page for Huvikumpu iltapäiväkerho ry

My first project is a afternoon club home page,which I implimented using bootstrap4 responsive CSS, for example it has a navbar which is fixed, a showcase area which is the home section and a background image as an overlay. 
Using grid I added some text its like introduction of afternoon club.  I used flex box to align icons with the text. 
Then there is head area , where I put some information about association, it has heading, text and buttons. Underneath it there is a image ,  some icons and text. At last there is simple footer which has contact form, which I made using light box, so user does not loose the main contact of the page. It also has smooth scrolling for menu items, I have implemented the page with bootstrap 4 responsive css style so the page can scale to different screen sizes without breaking the layout, for instance the navbar is converted into a buger menu on smaller screen size.
